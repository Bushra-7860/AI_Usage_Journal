Week 1

This week I used AI while working on the exercises to explain certain python 
concepts and to provide coding examples for concepts including f-strings and replace. 
I did not use AI to complete any of the exercises. I did not use AI for debugging. 
Here are my AI chat links. https://chatgpt.com/share/68c77576-649c-800e-945d-f2c9f3962bdf 

I tried out Copilot this week and did not have a good experience. 
After receiving generic results that did not give me clear responses to my questions. 
After giving clarity as to what I was asking the prompt was still not answered and responded
to move on rather than continue working. I learned a lot about why different AI models return such different
results on the same prompts. Turns out that it's about biases in their way of learning from their 
audiences and what its source is.  


Week 2
This week I did not use AI while working on the excercises at all. 
Instead I referenced our lecture as well as got help from our TA with 
certain errors that I did not understand.

For our week 2 discussion, I used ChatGPT to help with building a better study routine to stay ahead of assignments and ensure that I have a successful semester. I used ChatGPT because it gave the best results when I previously compared two different AI models. I gave a copy of my schedule and other commitments to formulate a schedule that best works for me. I found that the more input I give the AI the better the results but I have to be careful to not give to much information that it over looks my prompts.
