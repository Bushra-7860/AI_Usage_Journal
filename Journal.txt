Week 1

This week I used AI while working on the exercises to explain certain python 
concepts and to provide coding examples for concepts including f-strings and replace. 
I did not use AI to complete any of the exercises. I did not use AI for debugging. 
Here are my AI chat links. https://chatgpt.com/share/68c77576-649c-800e-945d-f2c9f3962bdf 

 

I tried out Copilot this week and did not have a good experience. 
After receiving generic results that did not give me clear responses to my questions. 
After giving clarity as to what I was asking the prompt was still not answered and responded
to move on rather than continue working. I ran a comparison test using the same documents and
prompts between Copilot and ChatGPT. They gave me different results even using the same prompts.
In the end, I optimized the prompt and documents for ChatGPT and was able to get results that
were close to the target. I learned a lot about why different AI models return such different
results on the same prompts. Turns out that it's about biases in their way of learning from their 
audiences and what its source is.
